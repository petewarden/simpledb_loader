This project explores the fastest way of loading large amounts of data into SimpleDB. You can either run a synthetic benchmark, or point it at a file of data you want to upload to SDB.

It now comes with pre-compiled Java binaries and a shell-script wrapper, so you can use it without having to compile it all yourself. To get started, cd into this directory and run
./sdbloader help
to see a mini-tutorial and manual.

To compile this yourself:

# First, cd into this directory in the terminal
# Then run this line to compile the class:
javac -cp lib/amazon-simple-db-2009-04-15-java-library.jar SimpleDBLoader.java

# You should then be able to run the loader class like this:
java -cp lib/amazon-simple-db-2009-04-15-java-library.jar:lib/commons-httpclient-3.0.1.jar:lib/commons-logging-1.1.jar:lib/commons-codec-1.3.jar:. SimpleDBLoader help
